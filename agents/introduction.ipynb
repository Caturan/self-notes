    "    3. Goal-Based Agents: Plan actions based on achieving specific goals.\n",
    "    4. Utility-Based Agents: Evaluate potential actions based on a utility function to maximize outcomes. \n",
    "- Examples include chatbots, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles, each utilizing different types of agents to perform tasks efficiently and intelligently. "
